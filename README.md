# TinyDB

TinyDB or `tinydb` is a small-footprint, superfast database designed to be used in-memory and easily dumped/retrieved from a file when it's time to save.

This database aims to provide an easy frontend to an efficiant in-memory database (that can also be dumped to a file). It purposefully disallows duplicate items to be sorted due to constraints with hash tables.
